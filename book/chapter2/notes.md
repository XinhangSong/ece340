Atoms and Electrons

2.2 Experimental Observations
---

**The photoelectric effect**
- blackbody radiation is emitted from heated samples, 
	- emitted in discrete units of energy called quanta
	- described by hv | v:=frequency of the radiation, h:= plancks constant

**Wave/Partical Duality**
- planks hypothesis and experiment
	- light energyy is contained in discrete units rather than in a continuous distribution of energies.
	- light has wave nature
		- but photons
			- quantized, localized units of light energy
	- photoelectron energy does not increase with light intensity
		- number of photoelectrons increases with intensity
		- higher intensity of light means more photons.  more photons hit electrons and free more photoelectrons
- youngs double slit experiment
	- diffraction and interference pattern is consistant with wave behavior
- De Broglie
	- particles of matter could also exhibit wave characteristics in some experiments
- Planck and De Broglie relationships are fundamental in quantum physics
	- valid for all situations and objects
	- connect wave description of phenomena (freq and wavelength) to particle description (energy and momentum)
		- dispersion relationship (relationship between freq and wavelength) not the same for different objects

**Atomic Spectra**
- energy is released from atoms with certain discrete energies

2.3 The Bohr Model
---
- relies on several postulates 
	- electrons exist in certain stable, circular orbits around the nucleus
		- implies the orbiting elecctron does not give off radiation, so it can keep its orbit
	- electron may shift to an orbit of higher or lower energy
		- thereby gaining or losing energy equal to the difference in energy levels
		- absorbing or emitting photons
	- angular momentum of the electron in an orbit is always an integral multiple of plancks constant divided by 2 Pi
		- necessary to get obvserved results from Paschen, Lyman, and Balmer, and was proposed just to make the data fit
		- inspired Schrodinger for his wave equation

2.4 Quantum Mechanics
===
- principles were developed from two different points of view at the same time
	- look different, but actually the same basic principles
- Heisenberg
	- *matrix mechanics* uses matrices
- Schrodinger
	- *wave mechanics* uses wave equation 

**Probability and the uncertainty principle**
- cant describe events on atomic scale with absolute precision
	- use expected values (averages) of position, momentum, and energy of particle
	- this is because absolute certainty doesnt exist on this scale.  
	- magnitude of the uncertainty is described by **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**
	- **simultaneous measurement of position and momentum, or of energy and time, is inherently inaccurate to some degree.**
	- cant look for *the* electron, but must find the *probability* of finding an electron at a certain position
		- use a probability density function for a particle in a certain environment to find expected values

**Schrodinger Wave Equation**
- Basic Postulates
	- Each particle in a physical system is described by a wavefunction Psi(x,y,z,t)
		- Psi and its derivative are continuous, finite, and single valued
	- When dealing with classical quantities like energy E and momentum p, we must relate these quantities with abstract quantum mechanical operators
	- The probability of finding a particle with wavefunction Psi in a volume dx dy dz is Psi Psi* dx dy dz
		- Psi Psi* is normalized so that the integral of Psi Psi* dx dy dz from negative infinity to positive infinity is 1
		- average value \<Q\> of some variable Q is calculated from the wavefunction by using operator form Q_op
			- \<Q\> = Integral of Psi\* Q_op Psi dx dy dz from negative infinity to positive infinity
		- the resulting equation includes both space and time dependencies
			- commonly the dependencies are calculated separately and then combined
- any arbitrary wavefunction can be written as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions
	- with pre-factors or weighting coefficients that depend on the initial conditions.

**Potential Well Problem**
- it's very difficult to find solutions to schrodinger equation for realistic situations, but there are problems that illustrate the theory
	- potential energy well with infinite boundaries 
	- V(x) = infinite for x = {0,L} else V(x) = 0
