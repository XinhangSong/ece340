Energy Bands and Charge Carriers in Semiconductors
===
3.1 Bonding Forces and Energy Bands in Solids
---
- electrons in solids are restricted to certain energies and are not allowed at other energies.  
	- has range of *band* of energies allowed per electron due to overlapping of wave functions of other electrons -- Pauli exclusion

**Bonding forces in solids**
- ionic bonding
	- mechanisms for alcali halides (alkali are the far left metals (one loose electron), halogens are just left of noble gases (one empty spot))
		- metal gives up its extra electrons to the nonmetal
		- the crystal then has structure of noble gases
		- but the ions have net electric charges which then act on all of the oppositely charged nearest neighbors, pulling them in tight.
		- all electrons are tightly bound to atoms, and are difficult to separate (relatively) => insulator
			- outer orbits are completely filled
			- no loosely bound outer orbiting electrons.  only filled shells
- metallic bonding
	- outer electron of each alkali atom is given to the crystal as a whole
	- solid is a bunch of ions with closed shells surrounded by a sea of free electrons
		- electrons are free to move around the crystal when influenced by electric field
	- lattice is held together by interaction of positive ion cores and surrounding free electrons

- covalent bonding
	- in the diamond lattice semiconductors (Ge, Si, C)
	- each atom shares its 4 outer electrons (valence electrons) with its four nearest neighbors 
		- bonding forces come from quantum mechanical interactions
		- each electron pair is a covalent bond, both electrons belong to the bond, not to a specific atom
			= each electron in a bond is indistinguishable, except with opposite spin to satisfy Pauli exclusion
	- no free electrons per se but electrons can be excited out of a bond
	- for compound semiconductors
		- mixed bonding - both ionic and covalent bonding
		- ionic bonding is affected by the separation in columns on the periodic table
			- becomes more important as the distance between the two elements increases

**Energy Bands**
- LCAO (Linear combinations of atomic orbitals)
	- wave function for two electrons on neighboring atoms can be superposed
	- form antibonding orbital and bonding orbital
		- bonding orbital corresponds to covalent bond
	- parallel spins repel each other => they go to antibonding states, opposite for antiparallel spins
	- can have many more than two interacting wave functions, orbitals => energy bands
	- lowest energy levels are for bonding, higher energy levels are for antibonding

**Direct and Indirect Semiconductors**
- direct semiconductors can have electrons fall from conduction band to valence band while keeping k constant
- indirect semiconductors must change k to switch bands for an electron
	- must change momentum and energy
	- generally, when involving a change of k, part of the energy is given up as heat to the lattice
- differences between direct and indirect semiconductors is important for choosing semiconductors with light output
	- LEDs and lasers need direct transitions or indirect but vertical transitions that use defect states 
		- give up the extra energy as a photon
